# Operators and Loops âž¿

## What is an expression in JavaScript?

> At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

## Why would we use a loop in our code?

> Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

## When does a ``for`` loop stop executing?

> The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop terminates. (If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)

## How many times will a ``while`` loop execute?

> A ``while`` statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
