# The Coder's Computer üíª

## What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. Code completion
1. Syntax highlighting
1. A nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
1. Ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

## What do the following commands do?

- ``pwd`` (print working directory) "you are here" command
- ``ls`` (list) list of contents of the folder where you are at
- ``cd`` by default takes you straight back to home
- ``mkdir newfoldername`` (make directory)
- ``touch newfilename.ext`` make new FILE; ext e.g. .md .html .css

## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

- ``cd projects`` (change directory to ``projects`` folder)
- ``mkdir new-project`` (make new directory of ``new-project``)
- ``touch new-project/newfile.md`` (make new FILE of ``new-file.md`` in the ``new-project`` directory)
- ``cd ..`` (navigate back a level dependent on dots, in this case, twice)
- ``ls projects/new-project`` (list the ``new-projects`` in the ``projects`` directory)

üí°TIP:

- Use tab button to auto complete
