## **Images, Color, Text**

### [1] <u>HTML</u>

- What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?

- How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

    > By having `alt` text.

- Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.

    > The `figure` element is semantic so it would clearly link the figure to the caption.

- Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

    > `gif` for simple images and animations

    > `svg` for user interface elements, icos, diagrams, etc.

- What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

    > PNG because of precise reproduction of source images.

- What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

    > Use web safe fonts for compatability.

    > `font-size` determines the size

    >  `font-weight` determines the boldness of the text
        > normal or bold
        > lighter or bolder
        > A number between 100-900
