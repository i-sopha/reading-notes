# Class 14 Notes

## [*CSS Transforms*](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

- What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

    > With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

- Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

    > A 6 sided die. For a game that reuires to roll the die.

## [*CSS Transitions & Animations*](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

- What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

    > With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

- How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

    > CSS transitions are generally best for simple from-to movements, while CSS animations are for more complex series of movements

## [*8 simple CSS3 transitions that will wow your users*](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/05/8-simple-css3-transitions-that-will-wow-your-users)

- What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?

    > CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.

- How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?

    > In game development I assume we'll need to know this on a high degree level in order to become more effective.
