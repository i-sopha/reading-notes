## **CSS Layout**

### Learn CSS - Flexbox

- Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

    > It excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.

- Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

    > The main axis represents the columns and the cross axis represents the rows Like 'x' and 'y' on a graph.

- How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

    > The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.

### CSS Layout - Flexbox

- What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

    1. Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
    2. Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
    3. Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

- How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

    > It would be much easier to style the content hence saving time on projects. Time is money!
