# Class 7 Notes

## **Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables**

### [*Domain Modeling*](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

- Explain why we need domain modeling.

    > To be able to verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders.

### [*HTML Table Basics*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics)

- Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

    > It reduces accessibility for visually impaired users, its harder to maintain and debug, and are not automatically responsive

- List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`

    > `th` used for heading `tr` used for rows `td` used for data

### [*Introducing Constructors*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)

- What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

    >  A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword. When you call a constructor, it will:

    > Advantages: create a new object, bind `this` to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code, run the code in the constructor, return the new object.

- How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

    > It can be instantiated into mutliple instances instead of one

### [*Object Prototypes Using A Constructor*](https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype)

- Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
- **NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question**

    > Prototypes references an object and is a mechanism by JS objects that inherits features from one another. Sort of like a blueprint?
