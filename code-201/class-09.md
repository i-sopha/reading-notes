- Why are forms so important in web development?

    > Web forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users — most commonly they are used for collecting data from users, or allowing them to control a user interface.

- When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

    > Need to learn some specific techniques to style form controls, and some scripting knowledge is required to handle things like validation and creating custom form controls.

- List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

    > `button` allows the user to send, or "submit", their data once they have filled out the form
    > `textarea` a multiline text field
    > `input` The <input> HTML element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. The <input> element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.
    > `label` represents a caption for an item in a user interface.
    > `form` defines a form

[*Introduction To Events*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events)

- How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

    > Just things that happen

- When using the `addEventListener()` method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

    > the string "click", to indicate that we want to listen to the click event.
    > a function to call when the event happens.

- Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

    > Sometimes, inside an event handler function, you'll see a parameter specified with a name such as event, evt, or e. This is called the event object, and it is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information.

- What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

    > Event bubbling describes how the browser handles events targeted at nested elements. An alternative form of event propagation is event capture. This is like event bubbling but the order is reversed.
