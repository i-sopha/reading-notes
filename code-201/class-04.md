# Class 4 Notes

## **HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout**

### [1] <u>HTML</u>

![HTML](./images/htmllink.png)

- To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

    > `<a>`

- The href attribute contains what information?

    > The url to the website

- What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

    > By adding supporting information with the `title` attribute

### [2] <u>CSS</u>

- What is meant by “normal flow”?

    > Default way of laying out elements

- What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

    > A block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and the element grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content.

    > The size of inline elements is just the size of their content. You can't set width or height on inline elements — they just sit inside the content of block level elements — except for images

- Block level positioning is the default for every html element.

- Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

    > Isolation of the element

    > Less dependent on floats

- What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

    > One key difference: whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

### [3] <u>JavaScript</u>

- Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

    > Declared functions are not executed untill it is invoked (or called).

- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

    > Parameters are arguments.

### [4] <u>Miscellaneous</u>

- Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

    > Learning from fellow students. Some people feel more comfortable speaking within peers that are not in authoritive positions and varying skill sets.

    > Social skills. For more introverted programmers out there to work with more people with or without different personalities in turn helping them grow.
